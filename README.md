# Hi! I'm Oisín.

I'm based in Dublin but originally from sweet, sweet Cavan. I'm a _very_ recent grad from UCD Computer Science in Dublin. I had a lot of fun there playing a big role in running [UCD Netsoc](https://netsoc.ucd.ie), as well as being an organiser for a student-run tech conference called [SISTEM](https://sistem.intersocs.ie) for two years in a row (including the 2020 edition in UCD). 

I've tried my hand at a lot of different tech over the past few years, but I've really gotten interested in front-end software development (especially React) in the past year. I did an internship at [HubSpot](https://github.com/hubspot/) doing work in React and Java. I'm starting back there as a full-time front-end software engineer _very_ soon.

I'm really into music. Check out my [last.fm](https://www.last.fm/user/Oisin1001/) and [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/1171185445) to see what I'm into. I also had a student radio show/podcast called [Quinntessentials](https://www.mixcloud.com/quinntessentials/) where I talked about some of my favourite albums with friends. It's a good listen, I promise!

I've a few random projects on here that might be interesting:
* [dBikes Planner](https://github.com/oisinq/dbikes-planner) is an Android app and Python API for generating smart cycling routes for Dublinbikes that takes into account bike availability at stations. You can grab the code, an .apk and my Final Year Project report (I got an A+!) in that repo.
* [Amhrán](https://github.com/oisinq/amhran) is a music site I built in React that showcased a new Irish song every day (or at least until I wasn't able to keep up with updating a website daily).
* [Paper Planes](https://github.com/DarraghClarke/Paper-Planes) was a really fun project to make: it's a distributed messaging app (aka WhatsApp clone) that was really satisfying (and a lil painful) to build.

Also here are my socials:
* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/oisinq_)
* [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/oisinq)
* that's all you're gettin', partner

Cool? Cool.
